# Go design patterns

Repository with examples of design patterns in the Go language. 
This repository was created to put the ideas from this book into code: [Go Design Patterns by Mario Contreras](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Mario-Castro-Contreras/dp/1786466201). The book itself has some issues, many of the code seems to have not been tested and some methods change name from one page to another, but I think the ideas are worth exploring.
